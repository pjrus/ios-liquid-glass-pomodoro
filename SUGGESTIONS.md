# ADHD-Friendly Pomodoro Features

Great question — Pomodoro apps can be *much* more ADHD-friendly with the right tweaks. Here are ideas that actually help with attention, motivation, and task initiation, not just aesthetics.

## 🧠 Attention & Focus Support

* **Gentle start mode**: 10–30s “warm-up” before the timer truly starts (reduces task-initiation friction).
* **Micro-Pomodoros**: 5–10 min focus options for low-energy days.
* **One-task lock**: Hide all other tasks once a session starts to reduce choice overload.
* **Visual time passing**: Shrinking circle / sand-timer style instead of just numbers.

## 🔔 Stimulation (without overload)

* **Adaptive sounds**: Low, non-jarring ticks, brown noise, or subtle heartbeat-style audio.
* **Randomized end cues**: A few different completion sounds to avoid habituation.
* **Haptic nudges**: Soft vibrations halfway through to re-anchor attention.

## 🔁 Flexibility (very important for ADHD)

* **“Pause without guilt” button**: Pause + resume without breaking streaks.
* **Session forgiveness**: Missed Pomodoro auto-converts to a shorter one instead of failing.
* **Break type choice**: Movement break, scroll break, water break, breathing break.

## 🎯 Motivation & Dopamine

* **Tiny rewards**: Confetti, coins, XP, or unlocking themes for *starting* a session (not just finishing).
* **Streaks for showing up**, not for perfect completion.
* **Progress bar for the day**: “You focused for 18 minutes today” is motivating.

## 🧩 Task Breakdown & Executive Function Help

* **Auto-chunking**: Turn a task into suggested 10-min chunks (“Write intro”, “Fix paragraph 2”).
* **Next-action prompt**: Before starting: *“What is the first tiny step?”*
* **Brain-dump inbox**: Quick add tasks without categorizing.

## 😌 Emotional Regulation & Burnout Prevention

* **Energy check-in**: “Low / Medium / High energy” → app adjusts session length.
* **Encouraging language**: “Nice showing up” instead of “Session failed”.
* **Overwhelm mode**: One button → 5 min focus + long break, no stats.

## 🧠 ADHD-specific Extras (stand-out features)

* **Body-doubling mode**: Silent shared timer with others or a virtual presence.
* **Time-blindness alerts**: “You’ve been focusing for 25 min” spoken gently.
* **Context memory**: Notes that reappear next time you resume a task.

## 🚫 Things to Avoid

* Harsh alarms ❌
* Punitive streak loss ❌
* Too many stats ❌
* Long setup flows ❌
